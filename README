NinjaForms
==========

This plugin adds an extended version of the great error_handling_form_for as seen on [TODO].
Most of the features can be deactivated and/or configured:

  * The (configurable) classname 'needed' is added to the label of a mandatory attribute.
    This is determined by validating an empty instance of the class and checking if errors have been added to it.
  * The missing form helper methods are added to the list of auto-labeled form helpers. The complete list reads: [TODO]
  * The new form helper 'calendar_picker' is added. It renders a text_field with an (optional) calendar icon and displays a JS calendar. 
  * ...
